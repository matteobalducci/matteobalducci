My Projects Legend:

1) "Final-Assignments-Boolean-Matteo-Balducci": in this project you can observe some of the mandatory exercises that I carried out to pass the Boolean course in data analytics, which deal with cleaning and graphic visualization of different .csvs with Python.
   
2) "RandomMIDIGen": this is a little Python project to quickly generate MIDI files ready for use and implementation on your DAW!
   
3) "final-warm-project": Final exam of the Boolean course in data analytics, I worked with a group of data analysts who are committed to carrying out a complete analysis relating to the rise in global temperatures, which is the object of the Paris Agreement.

4) The Titanic Kaggle competition challenges participants to predict the survival of passengers. I conducted an exploratory data analysis, revealing key predictors like gender, class, age, and embarkation point. I used a stacking ensemble model with 3 base learners and 1 meta-learner. ðŸ’»
